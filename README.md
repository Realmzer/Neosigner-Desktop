brew install ideviceinstaller
```

   - Run `python zsign_gui.py` in  terminal

2. **Sign an IPA**
   - Drag and drop  IPA file into the app
   - Select  signing certificate and provisioning profile
   - Adjust settings as needed (bundle ID, app name, etc.)
   - Click "Sign"

3. **Install to Device**
   - Connect your iOS device via USB
   - Trust the computer on your device if prompted
   - Click "Install" to deploy the signed app

4. **Advanced Options**
   - Inject dylibs by clicking "Add Dylib" and selecting your files
   - Enable ad-hoc signing for testing without a developer account
   - Customize zip compression level for smaller IPAs

## Troubleshooting
